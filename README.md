# Typescript Starter Project

This is a barebones project for starting a Typescript project running with Node.js

To get started, run `npm install` to install the dependencies, and then run `yarn test` to verify tests are running correctly. There are two tests, one of which is meant to fail. Once you have verified that the tests are running correctly, you can start writing your own tests and code, and delete the example test.
